HTML is the backbone of web development. Here are some simple tips to help you write better HTML:

## 1. Use Semantic Elements

Choose semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility and SEO. For example, use `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` to define the structure of your content clearly.

## 2. Optimize Images

Always include the `alt` attribute for images to describe their content. This helps with accessibility and SEO. Choose the right image format: use JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, and SVG for logos.

## 3. Utilize HTML5 Features

Take advantage of HTML5 input types to enhance forms:
- Use `<input type="email">` for email fields.
- Use `<input type="date">` for date pickers.

## 4. Keep Your Code Clean

Write clean and readable code. Use indentation and comments to make your code easier to understand.

## 5. Validate Your HTML

Use validation tools like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your HTML for errors and ensure it follows standards.

## Conclusion

By following these simple HTML tips, you can improve your web pages' quality and accessibility. Keep practicing, and your skills will grow!
